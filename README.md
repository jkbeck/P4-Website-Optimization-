Things I did:

Resized and compressed images for minimum file size.
Set javascript to async where possible.
Added media="print" to print.css
Minified JS and CSS files.
Changed google font from link href to javascript which increased scores by 3 desktop / 10 mobile

All Pagespeed scores over 90 for desktop over 80 for mobile.
